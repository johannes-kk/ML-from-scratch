# ML-from-scratch
Implementing seminal ML algorithms from scratch as a learning exercise.
Heavily inspired by Jason Brownlee's book "Machine Learning Algorithms From Scratch".

The aim was not to use any packages for data wrangling (e.g. Pandas) or off-the-shelf algorithms (e.g. scikit-learn), so as to learn the fundamentals.

Worked chronologically per the notebook numbering, with helper functions added to functions.py or extended along the way to reduce duplication of work. Code was heavily commented to enhance own learning.

Algorithms were typically tested on very simple contrived datasets to see that they worked as intended, then on a small open-source dataset to see more interesting results.
